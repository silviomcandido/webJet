@article{Candido2023a,
   abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jets are a highly promising technology for the generation of three-dimensional micro- and nanoscale structures, but the advancement of this technology is hindered by the insufficient understanding of many aspects of its flow mechanisms, such as the whipping behavior under larger electric potentials. A fully coupled numerical simulation of the three-dimensional electrohydrodynamic jet flow is used here since non-symmetric effects govern most of their EHD regimes. By applying considerable electric capillary numbers ( C a E > 0.25 ), we capture radial instabilities that until now no other numerical simulation was able to present. A comparison against previous two-dimensional axis-symmetric and validation with experimental studies of the Taylor cone jet is initially done. An exciting gain in accuracy was obtained, having an error of around 1.101% on the morphology against experimental results. Moreover, our numerical model takes into consideration the contact angle between the surface of the nozzle and the liquid, which is shown to be a very important variable for improved accuracy in the morphologic shape of the Taylor cone. Moreover, the three-dimensional structures and flow dynamics, under different electric capillary numbers, and their connection to the instabilities of the jet are studied. We present a novel visualization of the formation of droplet generation with the receded Taylor cone and the whipping dynamics.},

@article{Pendar2023,
   abstract = {The impetus of the current three-dimensional Eulerian-Lagrangian work is to analyze the impact of simultaneously using the inventive high-voltage conductors and Nitrotherm spraying technique for maximizing the industrial painting process efficiency. This investigation employs high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results in deep learning models as an input dataset. The novel conductors are called high-voltage retractable blades (HVRB) and high-voltage adjustable control-ring (HVACR) mounted on the head of the electrostatic rotating bell sprayer. The influence of dominant operational parameters, such as temperature and velocity of injected nitrogen or air, droplets' electric charge values, and their size ranges, and electric field density are examined in the considered database for the Nitrotherm spraying methodology. This broad range of parametric investigation illustrates that the inclusion of shaping nitrogen flow, manipulated electric field density, and droplet charging weights significantly affect the spraying deposition rate. The pressurized clean heated nitrogen flow, which is injected from the nozzles of the atomizers, positively redirects and harmonizes the charged droplets that construct an optimized spray plume pattern with a smaller diameter. Using innovative HVRB and HVACR conductors is manipulated the electric fields and leads to denser distribution, intensifying the acting electric force on the droplets, resulting in higher spraying transfer efficiency (TE) and thicker film formation. Based on the results, employing the introduced conductors in combination with the heated nitrogen instead of air leads to higher TE, rare overspray occurrence, formation of an esthetic paint film, lower paint consumption, and application time. Also, the collected complete database is employed for machine learning investigation to predict flow with high accuracy, aiming to reduce computational time/cost. A convolutional auto-encoder is used to reduce the computational cost with just 10% of the initial CFD computations, with a mean error of 1% on the prediction of the deposited droplet areas of the spray. The analysis revealed that by employing recurrent convolutional layers, superior capturing of the input pattern is obtained, which significantly aids the final prediction.},
